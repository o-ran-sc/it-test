This dockerfile implements a minimal robot framework container called
"nanobot", intended for automated testing or resource-limited
environments.

To build the container, first check the following ENV values at the
top of docker/nanobot/Dockerfile to ensure they reflect the RIC
platform deployment environment:

...
ENV RICPLT_NAMESPACE=ricplatform
ENV RICPLT_RELEASE_NAME=ric-full
ENV RICPLT_COMPONENTS="appmgr rtmgr dbaas e2mgr e2term"
...

Then, in the test/ric_robot_suite directory,  build the container:

$ docker build -f docker/nanobot/Dockerfile -t nanobot:v0.1 .

To run the container:

$ docker run --name nanobot -d nanobot:latest

By default, once started the container simply sleeps forever.

The container does not include any testsuites; either copy your tests
into a running container, or mount a directory of tests when starting
the container.  For example:

$ docker run -v /opt/robot/testsuites:/robot/testsuites --name nanobot -d nanobot:latest

Once started, the container will simply sleep forever.  To run a test
in the container, first copy a K8S credential file to
/kubernetes-admin-conf in the container:

$ docker cp ${KUBECONFIG} nanobot:/kubernetes-admin-conf

... then run the test:

$ docker exec nanobot robot /robot/testsuites/ricdeployment.robot
