This directory contains a Helm chart for the minimal robot container
and Kubernetes job.

The job mounts its testsuites directory as a configmap, built from
files in nanobot/configmap-src/testsuites.  Template expansion is
performed on files in that directory.

To install the chart, edit values.yaml to reflect your environment
and desired tests and run

$ helm install --namespace <namespace> nanobot

The namespace selected will be where the job's service account is
created and the job runs.  It may but need not be the same as the RIC
platform or xapp namespace.
