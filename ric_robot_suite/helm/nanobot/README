This directory contains a Helm chart for the minimal robot container
and Kubernetes job.

USING THE CHART
To install the chart (which creates and runs a single Kubernetes job),
first copy the packaged Common-Template chart (from
https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/it/dep.git) into
ric_robot_suite/helm/nanobot/charts.  Then, edit
ric_robot_suite/helm/nanobot/values.yaml to reflect your
environment and desired tests and run

$ helm install [--values <override-file> ] --namespace <namespace> nanobot

... in the ric_robot_suite/helm directory, where <override-file>
is the recipe override file used when deploying the RIC, if any.  The
output from the test will be in the job's log:

kubectl logs --namespace <namespace> job/nanobot-r0-ric-robot-run

(the job name may be different if you have altered the values.yaml
file; use 'kubectl --namespace <namespace> get jobs' to find it).

The namespace selected will be where the job's service account is
created and the job runs.  It may but need not be the same as the RIC
platform or xapp namespace â€”- the chart may be deployed in any
namespace.

CUSTOMIZING AND EXTENDING THE CHART
The job mounts its testsuites directory as a configmap, built from
files in nanobot/configmap-src/testsuites.  Template expansion is
performed on files in that directory.

Configuration of the chart is split between the "recipe" used to
deploy the RIC (and consumed by the ric-common chart, which is
required for this chart) and the chart's own values.yaml file.
Generally, RIC platform configuration is specified by the recipe, and
robot and xapp configuration from the chart's values.yaml, although
there is some overlap.

Support files (testsuites, keyword definition libraries, scripts, and
variable definition files) for the robot framework itself are supplied
by k8s configmaps generated from the contents of subdirectories of the
configmap-src directory; those subdirectories may contain one or more of
the following directories:

bin/:        scripts/binaries, mounted at /robot/bin
testsuites/: test suites, mounted at /robot/testsuites
properties/: variable definition (properties) files;
             contents mounted at /robot/resources
resources/:  robot keyword definition libraries, contents
             mounted at /robot/resources

Helm template expansion is performed on the contents of all
directories.
Because both resources/ and properties/ are mounted at
robot/resources, care should be taken to ensure that names do not
collide across those directories, particularly between trees.

The job uses the nanobot docker image built by
ric_robot_suite/docker/nanobot/Dockerfile; see
ric_robot_suite/docker/nanobot/README for information about the
image.
