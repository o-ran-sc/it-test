This directory contains containers, Helm charts, libraries, and
testsuites to support automated, end-to-end testing of the RIC.
Testing is implemented in the Robot Framework (robotframework.org).

The simplest way to execute the tests is using the helm chart in
ric_robot_suite/helm/nanobot.  See ric_robot_suite/helm/nanobot/README
for instructions on configuring, installing, and extending the chart.
The chart depends on the docker image in docker/nanobot.

   |- ric-python-utils : RIC test-support libraries; these are built into the
                         docker image.
   |- robot/           : Test libraries, testsuites, and support files to be
                         built into the docker image
   |- xapp/            : Go source and deployment files for the test xapp
