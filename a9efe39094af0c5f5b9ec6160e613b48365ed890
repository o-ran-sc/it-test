      "message": "this is probably totally unnecessary, but would it make sense, rather than checking for the pods, to look at the deployments instead?  something like:\n\nkubectl -n ${NAMESPACE} get deployment ${DEPLOYMENT} \\\n         -o template \\                                                                                                              \n         --template\u003d \\\n        \u0027{{if (or .status.readyReplicas 0) | eq .status.replicas}}READY{{else}}NOTREADY{{end}}\u0027\n\n.. in a loop with a sleep 1 for timeout purposes.  that way if a deployment has more than one pod, you don\u0027t try to hit it until they\u0027re all running.\n\nagain, probably pedantic and unnecessary, but a bit more elegant.",
