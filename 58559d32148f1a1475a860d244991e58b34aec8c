      "message": "A POWDER profile encapsulates everything needed to run an experiment. It consists of two main parts: a description of the resources (hardware, storage, network, etc.) needed to run the experiment, and the software artifacts that run on those resources. An experiment is an instantiation of a profile. For example, under the osc project we have created a profile called \"\tXTesting-Ubuntu20\" which installs all the software dependencies for running the XTesting framework on server with the Ubuntu-20 OS; Another example is the \"osc-ricplt\" which installs the latest OSC RIC platform with Ubuntu 20.04 on a hardware type of your choice. So by instantiating an instance of a given profile it sets up a stage for an initial test set up, to be further used for integration tests, CI/CD pipeline etc. This code change is to provide a programmable way to instantiate a POWDER experiment. Upon successful instantiation, the node(s) can be used for OSC tests.",
