This repository contains tools for end-to-end testing of the RIC.  Among the included tools:

o In simulators/, an implementation of the gNodeB E2 interface to allow
testing without a live gNodeB and a workload generator to exercise the
interfaces between XApps
o In ric_robot_suite/, implementations of the Robot Framework
(robotframework.org) to enable end-to-end test automation for
development and integration testing.

These components generally assume a deployed and running RIC.

See the component subdirectories for documentation on the components themselves.
