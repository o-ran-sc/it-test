      "message": "Could this file live in the docker image tree, rather than here?  It seems like SDL is more a platform thing than a RIC thing.  I could be convinced otherwise, though.\n\nI _think_ we might need to bump the docker container version as part of this process as well, but I\u0027m not sure.",

If it\u0027s doing more than that, please implement that as a combination of python libraries and robot framework code.",
